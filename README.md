# Angular-Routes-Solo
Hey everybody!

In this assignment we will be using Angular Routes to display information on 3 fictional characters of your choice. Your page should have a header and footer of some kind, and 3 buttons to swap out the content of the characters. 

Sample Characters

* Harry Potter (Harry Potter books/movies)
* Storm (X-Men)
* Frodo (Lord of the Rings)
* Samus Aran (Metroid)
* Indiana Jones (movies)
* Michonne (Walking Dead)

## Content
Feel free to use Google for the content or make up your own! Include some images and give it your best styling effort. 

## Hard Mode
Use `ng-show`, `ng-hide`, or `ng-if` to add some dynamic elements to your views when users click on things.

## Pro Mode
Make the whole experience responsive with [media queries] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) or by using a library such as Bootstrap.
